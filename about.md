  Hello, all
</p>
<p>
  Welcome to my personal site. I'm Ahmed, a software engineer by day and a ... by night (I try to sleep, its healthy). I also occasionally dabble in enterpreneurship (I've yet to suceed!) and writing (I wrote a book!). When I'm not being conventionally productive, I like to lift, play football (soccer), cook (not well), and hike. 
</p>
<p>
  I've also been freelancing (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.classpulse.org"> Class Pulse </a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://hivemapper.com"> Hivemapper </a>) and consulting. If you have something interesting, reach out! And if you're an NGO working on a cause I support, I try to do pro bono work every now and then, so please feel free to contact me. 
</p>
<p>
  What are causes I support? Inclusion and disability rights (check out: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.etivision.org"> ETI</a>) & combating racism, bias and discrimination of all kinds. 
</p>
  Cheers,
  Ahmed (who stayed long enough in Manchester to think he's British)
  p.s. if you're Mo Salah (or, Lebron James, Trevor Noah, Childish Gambino, or anyone who works for Digital Corridor) and reading this - please please email me.
